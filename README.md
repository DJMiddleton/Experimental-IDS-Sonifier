# Experimental-IDS-Sonifier
I design and create an experimental intrusion detection system that uses sonification and aural feedback to relay network information to the user as opposed to traditional visual methods. The main component of the IDS-sonifier is the Python program 'IDS-Sonifier.py' which performs packet analysis on the local network connection, picks up on potential attacks and relays the information to the sonification controller which runs using Pure Data. The IDS-sonifier I created was used in a live study on human participants to examine the benefits to a user's situational awareness when compared with traditional IDS's such as Snort IDS.
