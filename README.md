# Experimental-IDS-Sonifier
I design and create an experimental intrusion detection system that uses sonification and aural feedback to relay network information to the user as opposed to traditional visual methods. The IDS I created was used in a live study on human participants to examine the benefits to a user's situational awareness when compared with traditional IDS's such as Snort IDS.
